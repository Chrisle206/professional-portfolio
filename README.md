# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## professional-portfolio
This week I created a web application from scratch. This website is a mock-portfolio which will continue to see modifications as the months progress. It is suppose to showcase my current skills and allow other people to view the work I have done. In this project I use flexbox, boostrap, and css variables.
